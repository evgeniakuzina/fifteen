# fifteen
CS50 problem set 3


Fifteen is a simple Game of Fifteen.

For this task I had some distribution code and I fully implemented 4 functions 
in fifteen.c:

- init that initializes the board;
- draw that draws a board on the screen;
- move that moves tiles nd checks if the move is legitimate;
- won that constantly checks if the user won.
